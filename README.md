## Blogs

Welcome to the Blogs project! This is a simple Next.js application for managing and displaying blog posts. This README provides an overview of the project and instructions for running it.

## Description

The Blogs project is a web application for managing and displaying blog posts. It uses Next.js, React, and local storage to store and retrieve blog data. Users can create new blog posts, edit existing ones, and view blog details.


This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
